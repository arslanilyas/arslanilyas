Over the years, Iâ€™ve contributed to various innovative projects that push the boundaries of multimedia and streaming technologies.

- **Multimedia Expertise:** Developed advanced applications using ReplayKit, VideoToolbox, AudioToolbox, 4264 encoding, AAC encoding, RTMP, HLS streaming, and UPNP/DLNA standards.
- **Project Leadership:** An agile-focused Scrum Master with a strong track record of leading development teams and contributing to project success.
